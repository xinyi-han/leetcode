# Description:
# There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of
# painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent
# houses have the same color.
#
# The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0]
# is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so
# onâ€¦ Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.
